# Crop Yield Prediction

## Description:
Predicting crop yield is crucial for efficient agricultural planning and resource allocation. This project leverages machine learning techniques to forecast crop yields based on various factors such as crop type, seasonal patterns, geographical location, and agricultural inputs. The predictive models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree, provide valuable insights for farmers and stakeholders in optimizing crop production.

## Key Features:
- **Data Exploration:** Gain insights into the distribution of crops, seasonal variations, and state-wise yield patterns.
- **Preprocessing:** Clean and transform the dataset, handling categorical variables, and scaling numerical features for model training.
- **Model Selection:** Explore multiple regression and classification models, including Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assess model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and R-squared.
- **Business-Oriented Visualizations:** Informative visualizations for stakeholders, showcasing crop distribution, yield trends, and input usage.

## How to Use:
1. **Dataset:** Explore the provided dataset containing information on crops, seasons, states, and various agricultural factors.
2. **Preprocessing:** Understand the steps taken to clean and preprocess the dataset for machine learning.
3. **Model Training:** Implement and train regression and classification models to predict crop yield and classify it as high or low.
4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the models using relevant metrics to understand their performance.
5. **Visualizations:** Utilize business-oriented visualizations for a comprehensive understanding of crop-related patterns.

## Benefits:
- **Optimized Planning:** Enable farmers and agricultural planners to make informed decisions based on predicted crop yields.
- **Resource Allocation:** Efficiently allocate resources such as fertilizers and pesticides to maximize yield.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Anticipate potential risks and challenges in crop production, aiding in risk management strategies.
